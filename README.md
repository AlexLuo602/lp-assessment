# System Design Assessment

Hi, there is no coding aspect for the system design assessment. The interviewer will share with you a problem.
You will be asked to design a system that solves the problem.

For demonstration purposes, we would like you to sketch it out/write it on an online whiteboarding tool.
You can use any tool you are comfortable with. Here are some suggestions:

- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)
- [Tldraw](https://www.tldraw.com/)

You can use other tools as long as they allow you to freely share the link with the interviewer. But we think the simpler tools above help you focus on the design rather than the tool itself.

### Tips

1. **Clarify the requirements**: Make sure you understand the requirements before you start designing the system. Ask questions if you are unsure about the requirements.
2. **Start with the high-level design**: Start with the high-level design and then drill down to the details.
3. **Focus on scalability**: Make sure your system is scalable. Think about how it will handle a large number of users or a large amount of data.
4. **Openly ask and discuss trade-offs**: Discuss trade-offs with the interviewer. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, and it's important to understand the trade-offs of different design decisions.
