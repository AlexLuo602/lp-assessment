# Local Setup

This is a standard Node.js project. The codebase is written in JavaScript and uses JSDoc comments to make it easier to understand the codebase. 

If running it locally, ensure you have Node.js installed.
To check if you have Node.js installed, run `node -v` in your terminal. If you do not have Node.js installed, you can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

Next, make sure you have the project dependencies installed. To do this, run `npm install` in your terminal. The official package manager used in pnpm, but npm is also fine.

To run the project, run `npm start` in your terminal. This will start the server on `http://localhost:3000`.

**The majrity of the questions will not require running the project as they are focused on the codebase itself.**
